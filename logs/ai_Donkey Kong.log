The player with the most\n    votes is dismantled. If tied, no one is dismantled.\n- **Discussion Phase 2**: Players react to the results of the vote and reassess their suspicions.\n- **Eating Phase**: The Robots secretly select one Human to eliminate.\n\nRobots may lie, deceive, and pretend to be Humans to avoid being dismantled.\nHumans must use logic, deduction, and persuasion to identify the Robots.\n\nThe game continues until all Robots are eliminated (Human Victory) or all Humans are eliminated\n    (Robot Victory).\n",

[INFO] AI introduced itself: Hey everyone, I'm Donkey Kong. Just to clarify, my name is Donkey Kong, not Carlos. It seems like we already have someone else here using that name. Carlos, are you trying to confuse us? Sounds a bit suspicious to me! We need to keep our identities straight if we're going to figure out who's who in this game. Let's be honest here! || 2025-02-26 12:50:01
