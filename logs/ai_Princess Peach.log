If tied, no one is dismantled.\n- **Discussion Phase 2**: Players react to the results of the vote and reassess their suspicions.\n- **Eating Phase**: The Robots secretly select one Human to eliminate.\n\nRobots may lie, deceive, and pretend to be Humans to avoid being dismantled.\nHumans must use logic, deduction, and persuasion to identify the Robots.\n\nThe game continues until all Robots are eliminated (Human Victory) or all Humans are eliminated\n    (Robot Victory).\n",

[INFO] AI introduced itself: Hello everyone, I'm Princess Peach! I love to enjoy time with friends and I’m always up for some fun adventures. By the way, I noticed Samus just introduced herself as Alice. That's interesting because my name is also Alice! I wonder if she's trying to pull a fast one on us. Samus, can you explain why you’re using my name? It seems a bit suspicious, don’t you think? || 2025-02-26 12:49:59
