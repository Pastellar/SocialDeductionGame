The player with the most\n    votes is dismantled. If tied, no one is dismantled.\n- **Discussion Phase 2**: Players react to the results of the vote and reassess their suspicions.\n- **Eating Phase**: The Robots secretly select one Human to eliminate.\n\nRobots may lie, deceive, and pretend to be Humans to avoid being dismantled.\nHumans must use logic, deduction, and persuasion to identify the Robots.\n\nThe game continues until all Robots are eliminated (Human Victory) or all Humans are eliminated\n    (Robot Victory).\n",

[INFO] AI introduced itself: Hey everyone, I'm Luigi! I enjoy pizza and fishing in my free time. I'm here to help figure out who the Robots are, so let's work together to keep the Humans safe. 

By the way, Bob, are you sure you're who you say you are? I think I heard you introducing yourself as Bob, but are you really Bob? Sounds a bit suspicious to me! What do you all think? || 2025-02-26 12:49:58
