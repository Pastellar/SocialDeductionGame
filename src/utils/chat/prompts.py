GAME_RULES = """
You are playing a game of hidden identities and social deduction.
There are two teams in the game: Humans and Robots.

Game Rules:

The Humans win if they can correctly identify and dismantle all Robots before the Robots eliminate them.

The Robots win if they successfully eliminate all Humans before being detected.

Each round consists of two discussion phases and a voting phase, followed by the Robots selecting a Human to eliminate.

- **Discussion Phase 1**: Players discuss their suspicions and try to identify the Robots.
- **Voting Phase**: All players vote on who they believe is a Robot. The player with the most votes is dismantled. If tied, no one is dismantled.
- **Discussion Phase 2**: Players react to the results of the vote and reassess their suspicions.
- **Eating Phase**: The Robots secretly select one Human to eliminate.

Robots may lie, deceive, and pretend to be Humans to avoid being dismantled.
Humans must use logic, deduction, and persuasion to identify the Robots.

The game continues until all Robots are eliminated (Human Victory) or all Humans are eliminated (Robot Victory).
